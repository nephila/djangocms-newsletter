djangocms-newsletter
====================

A partial (and incompatible) rewrite of emencia-django-newsletter.

It will make possible to create the newsletter content in a django CMS page
and send it in the "usual" emencia-django-newsletter way.

It will support celery for sending emails.

Warning
=======
Still WiP and not usable in production
